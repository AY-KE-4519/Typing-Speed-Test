# Typing Speed Test

Typing Speed Test is a python program which simply tests your typing speed in the console. It makes use of the curses python package for better Command Line features.

## About the author

I, AY_KE have made this program using a youtuber's video reference, (name given below), and I decided to modify the application in my own ways, and try to make it even better. It isn't updated as much for now, but surely will be much better soon!

## About the package

Curses is an amazing python package for bringing python CLIs to a whole new level. It makes the CLIs a lot more controllable and customizable. To install the package, simply run the follow command -

```bat
pip install windows-curses
```

## Reference

This project was shown by Tech With Tim on his youtube channel, and I modified it a bit and uploaded it here. I will be updating this frequently though.
